This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to manage an Expo project.  The specific error message might vary but often involves issues with dependencies, native modules, or incorrect configurations within the project's `package.json` or `app.json` files.  For example, a common symptom is encountering build errors during the `expo prebuild` or `expo build` process.  The errors might indicate missing dependencies, version conflicts, or problems linking native libraries.
