The solutions to these uncommon Expo CLI errors often require a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Verify Package.json:** Double-check that all dependencies are correctly specified, and resolve version conflicts by carefully reviewing the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. Use tools like `npm-check-updates` to check for outdated packages.
2. **Clean and Rebuild:** Completely remove the `node_modules` folder, clear the cache (`expo start --clear`), and then reinstall dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).
3. **Native Module Linking:**  If the error relates to native modules (e.g., camera, location), ensure that the necessary native modules are correctly configured and linked. Consult the documentation for the specific native module involved.
4. **Expo SDK Version:**  Ensure your Expo SDK version is compatible with your project's dependencies and other components.  Check the Expo release notes for any known issues with your current SDK version.
5. **Environment Variables:** Verify that environment variables (if used) are correctly set. Incorrect environment variables can lead to unexpected build errors. 
6. **Check Expo Docs:** Consult the official Expo documentation for any known issues or relevant troubleshooting steps. 
7. **Debugging:** Use debugging tools such as the Expo developer tools to pinpoint the specific location and cause of the error. Examine error logs carefully to identify the root cause. 
8. **Community Support:** If you still cannot resolve the error, consider posting to the Expo community forums or seeking help from other developers.  Include detailed error messages, relevant code snippets, and project configurations.
